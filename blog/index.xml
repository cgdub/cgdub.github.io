      <description>If you work with enough programmers, eventually you&amp;rsquo;ll work with a fan of mechanical keyboards.
My first mechanical was the Poker II. At the time, I used Vim bindings for programming, in both IDEA and Emacs, and the Poker II is a great keyboard for Vim fans. It features a 60% layout, the backtick key is mapped to escape, and it&amp;rsquo;s programmable. You can reprogram many of the keys and key combinations as well as program simple macros into the keyboard.</description>
